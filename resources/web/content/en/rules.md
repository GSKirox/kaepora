# Rules
1. **OOTR Ladder races are for everyone, be nice and remember the human.**
2. Streaming your races is mandatory and providing VoDs is your only recourse
   if you have to prove you did not cheat.
3. Cheating in any form will result in a permanent ban, this includes (but is
   no limited to):
    1. Any attempt to guess or _stream-snipe_ your opponent.
    2. Exploring the seed before the race officially starts.
    3. Being fed spoilers from your chat.
4. Races can be freely joined and canceled one hour before they start.  
   Fifteen minutes before the races start you get your _seed_ and can no longer
   `!join` or `!cancel`, if you can no longer race you have to `!forfeit`.
5. The race starts when it is planned to start and won't be delayed, if you are
   not ready when Kaepora gives you the "go", it's on you.
6. Any `!done` or `!forfeit` is definitive as you will receive both the spoiler
   log for your seed and your opponent name.
7. To win you need to complete your race, even if your opponent forfeited.
